# Obfiscate

## Features

- Obfuscation of code to make it difficult to understand.
- Functional programming paradigm.
- function random delay
- function and variable numbering

## Configuration

To configure the obfuscation process, you can set the following options:

- `obfuscationSeed`: The seed value used for the random number generator during obfuscation. The same seed value will produce the same obfuscated code each time.
- `maxFileSize`: The maximum allowed file size in characters for the obfuscated code.
- `obfuscatedFilePath`: The path to the .obf file containing your obfuscated code.

## Examples

You can find example code in the examples/ directory.

## Security Warning

**Obfiscate** is designed for educational and recreational purposes only. It is not suitable for commercial use or for running untrusted code, as the obfuscation process does not provide true security.

The use of `eval` and obfuscated code poses security risks, and executing obfuscated code from untrusted sources can be dangerous. Do not use this library in production environments or to run code from untrusted sources.
